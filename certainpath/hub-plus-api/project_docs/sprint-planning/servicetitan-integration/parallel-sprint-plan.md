## Dependency Analysis & Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **ST-001** → **ST-002, ST-003, ST-006** → **ST-004** → **ST-009** → **ST-010, ST-014**
2. **ST-005, ST-008** → **ST-004** (parallel to path 1)
3. **ST-014** → **ST-015, ST-016** → Phase 4 components

### Parallel Development Opportunities

#### Sprint 1-2: Foundation Parallelism
- **Entity design** (Dev A) || **Value objects** (Dev B) || **Security setup** (Dev C)
- **Maximum parallelization**: 3 developers working independently

#### Sprint 3: API Development Parallelism  
- **Data transformation** (Dev A) || **API client development** (Dev B)
- **Dev A can use mock data while Dev B builds real API client**

#### Sprint 5: Frontend/Backend Parallelism
- **Security implementation** (Dev C) || **Controller/DTO development** (Dev D)
- **Controllers can be designed against service interfaces**

#### Sprint 6: Testing & Production Parallelism
- **Error handling** (Dev C) || **Commands** (Dev B) || **Testing** (Dev A & D) || **Config** (Dev D)
- **Maximum parallelization**: All 4 developers working on different aspects**

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Dependency Risk
- **Risk**: Blocked development due to dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Interface-first development, mocking, early design reviews

#### Integration Risk  
- **Risk**: Components don't integrate properly
- **Mitigation**: Daily integration testing, shared interfaces, regular demos

#### Resource Contention Risk
- **Risk**: Developers need same resources/files
- **Mitigation**: Clear module boundaries, Git branching strategy, communication protocols

#### Quality Risk
- **Risk**: Parallel development compromises quality
- **Mitigation**: Continuous integration, peer reviews, automated testing

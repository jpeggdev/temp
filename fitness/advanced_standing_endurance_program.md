# 8-Week Advanced Standing Endurance & Core Strength Program

## Program Overview

This program is designed for someone who has been cleared for all activities post-spinal surgery but struggles with prolonged standing due to weak core muscles. The focus is on building functional core strength and gradually increasing standing tolerance through progressive, targeted exercises.

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase time, resistance, or complexity
2. **Functional Focus**: Every exercise translates to better standing ability
3. **Fatigue Management**: Strategic rest periods and position changes
4. **Core Integration**: Core engagement in every movement pattern

## Equipment Needed

- Resistance bands (light, medium, heavy)
- Dumbbells (5-15 lbs to start)
- Stability ball (optional but recommended)
- Kitchen timer or smartphone
- Sturdy chair
- Wall space

## FATIGUE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

### During Exercise

1. **Micro-Breaks**: Take 5-10 second pauses within sets
2. **Breathing Focus**: Never hold breath; exhale on exertion
3. **Position Changes**: Alternate between exercises that load different areas
4. **Quality Over Quantity**: Stop set when form deteriorates

### For Standing Endurance

1. **Weight Shifting**: Regularly shift weight between feet
2. **Mini Movements**: Small marches, calf raises, hip circles
3. **Posture Resets**: Every 5 minutes, reset shoulders and engage core
4. **Compression**: Consider compression garments for additional support

### Recovery Tactics

1. **Legs Up Wall**: 5-10 minutes after training
2. **Foam Rolling**: Focus on calves, IT bands, and glutes
3. **Epsom Salt Baths**: 2-3 times per week
4. **Adequate Protein**: 0.8-1g per pound body weight for recovery

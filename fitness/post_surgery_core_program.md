# 8-Week Progressive Core Strengthening Program for Post-Spinal Surgery Recovery

## IMPORTANT MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
**STOP - READ THIS FIRST:**
- **You MUST obtain clearance from your surgeon or physical therapist before starting this program**
- This program is a general guide and should be modified based on your specific surgery and recovery
- Your medical team may need to approve or modify these exercises
- Never work through sharp pain, numbness, or tingling
- If you experience any concerning symptoms, stop immediately and contact your healthcare provider

## Program Overview
This 8-week program is designed to safely rebuild core strength after spinal surgery, progressing from very gentle movements to more challenging exercises. The focus is on developing the strength needed to stand comfortably for extended periods.

### Key Principles:
1. **Start extremely slowly** - Your body needs time to heal and adapt
2. **Quality over quantity** - Perfect form is more important than repetitions
3. **Listen to your body** - Some discomfort is normal, pain is not
4. **Consistency matters** - Small efforts daily are better than sporadic intense sessions
5. **Both sides matter** - Work anterior (front) and posterior (back) core equally

### Warning Signs to STOP Exercise:
- Sharp, shooting, or stabbing pain
- Numbness or tingling in legs or feet
- Increased pain at surgical site
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Unusual swelling
- Any symptom your surgeon warned you about

### Good Discomfort vs. Bad Pain:
- **Good**: Mild muscle fatigue, gentle stretching sensation, feeling of work
- **Bad**: Sharp pain, joint pain, nerve symptoms, pain that persists after stopping

## WEEKS 1-2: Foundation Phase - Activation & Breathing

**Goal**: Reactivate core muscles safely, establish breathing patterns, begin gentle movement

**Frequency**: Daily, 5-10 minutes total

### Exercise 1: Diaphragmatic Breathing (Lying Down)

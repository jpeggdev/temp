### Dependency Injection

All services are registered with the DI container:

```csharp
// Notification Services
services.AddScoped<INotificationEngine, NotificationEngine>();
services.AddScoped<ISmartNotificationScheduler, SmartNotificationScheduler>();
services.AddScoped<INotificationPreferenceService, NotificationPreferenceService>();
services.AddScoped<IAlertManager, AlertManager>();
services.AddScoped<INotificationChannelManager, NotificationChannelManager>();

// Automation Services  
services.AddScoped<IAutomationEngine, AutomationEngine>();
services.AddScoped<IAutomationActionExecutor, AutomationActionExecutor>();
services.AddScoped<IAutomationTriggerManager, AutomationTriggerManager>();

// Notification Channels
services.AddScoped<InAppNotificationChannel>();
services.AddScoped<EmailNotificationChannel>();
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Notification

```csharp
var notificationId = await notificationEngine.SendNotificationAsync(
    title: "Task Reminder",
    content: "Don't forget to review the project proposal",
    type: NotificationType.TaskReminder,
    priority: NotificationPriority.Medium,
    channel: NotificationChannel.Push,
    recipientId: "user123");
```

### Creating an Automation Rule

```csharp
var triggers = new List<AutomationTrigger>
{
    AutomationTrigger.CreateTimeTrigger("Daily Standup", DateTime.Today.AddHours(9))
};

var actions = new List<AutomationAction>
{
    AutomationAction.CreateNotificationAction(
        "Standup Time!", 
        "Time for the daily standup meeting")
};

var ruleId = await automationEngine.CreateAutomationRuleAsync(
    "Daily Standup Reminder",
    "Reminds team about daily standup",
    triggers,
    new List<AutomationCondition>(),
    actions);
```

### Using Notification Templates

```csharp
var variables = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    ["userName"] = "John Doe",
    ["taskTitle"] = "Complete Project Review",
    ["dueDate"] = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1)
};

await notificationEngine.SendNotificationFromTemplateAsync(
    templateId: deadlineReminderTemplateId,
    variables: variables,
    recipientId: "user123");
```

## Performance Considerations
